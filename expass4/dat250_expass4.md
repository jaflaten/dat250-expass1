# experiment 4 for JÃ¸rn-Are Flaten student nr 240425


## exp 1
Experiment 1 was simple and straight forward to complete. No issues occurred during this assignment. Screenshots are provided to show the results. 


## exp 2
In experiment 2 i had some trouble understand what i had to implement, and what i did not have to implement. After i understood what to work on it was fairly ok. Had some trouble due to a coding error where i did not initialize the list of todos and received some GSON errors complaining about wanting an object array for instance but found an object. 



All the tests runs successfully as the screenshot provded shows. The fork of the repo also runs the tests as part of the workflow. The forked repo can be found here https://github.com/jaflaten/dat250-sparkjava-counter , but the code is also available inside the same folder as this document. 


This was my first experience with spark and i find that i prefer spring boot instead. as it has boilerplate and gives you so much spring logic (magic) out of the box.

I have setup swagger for our group project, but i chose not to do the swagger or xml representation tasks as they were optional.
