# DAT250 Expass 6 for JÃ¸rn-Are Flaten student 240425


## Experiment 1
Experiment 1 completed without issues. All tasks solved and screenshots provided as proof. 
Spring MVC is familiar to me so this was simple.

Code available under the springmvc folder. 



## Experiment 2
This has been the first time i used Angular and to prepare i followed the tutorial https://angular.io/tutorial to get familiar with this technology. I invested quite a bit of time to go through this and try to understand what i was doing. 

Thanks to the work i did in the tutorial this was doable. I would have had no chance without going through the tutorial first. CSS is still a black box to me, but Angular basics is starting to dawn on me. 

Had some slight issues with the CORS config as the angular app was calling itself instead of the server. After i changed the proxy config to use the suggested solution proposed by the lecturer this worked fine. 


Code available in the subfolder /expass6-frontend in the same folder as this file.
I updated my todo api to be ```/api/todos``` instead of just /todos. so the frontend is assuming that URL. Added todos code also in /todos folder. 



## Exp 3

Currently not implemented.. will see if i get time to do it later and update repo...
